***  _The payout wasn't offered in this case as they argued that no funds were at risk at the time due to low traction for these features._ 
_However, these features were publicly available, declared safe and audited, in production, and announced as a major release on their socials._
_There should have been at least a minimum critical payout, but since they had no official bug bounty program, there was no other option._
